# 4.2.7

# Features: 
- Page size is now saved between sessions, and is more flexible.
  You can now enter any page size (up to 1000), without it affecting the URL parameters.  
  The URL only tracks the first result and number of results requested, while the page size is stored in localstorage.  
  This allows more flexible paging without cluttering the URL.  
  When you send a link to someone else, they will see the same results you intended, but with their own preferred page size,
  the results you actually meant to send will have a highlight color on them.

# Improvements: 
- Improve builtin TEI article stylesheet
- Preserve active filter/annotation tab in URL

# Misc:
- Minor optimizations when paginating through results
