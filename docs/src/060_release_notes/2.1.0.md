# 2.1.0

For use with [Blacklab 2.0 ](https://github.com/INL/BlackLab/releases/tag/v2.0.0-RC1)

# Features
- New word detail tooltips in documents! See the [docs](https://github.com/INL/corpus-frontend/tree/b36b016e092575bdce97b6e1b5ead6b83bce81a1#frontend-configuration) for how to configure them.
- Added option to set the displayed annotation in the left/hit/right context columns
- Added option to display context columns unescaped. This allows you to display and style xml to enable various inline features. 
- Added option to disable/hide the query builder
- Added support for opening the dev version on other computers on the network

# Fixes
- Fixed misplaced spinner while lexicon service is updating
- Fixed `within` never showing any available options (even when the corpus does contain inline tags!)
- Fixed disabling page size not working for links in the results table
- Fixed annotations without forward index being allowed in the results table (they would never show any data - as a forward index is required for that)
- Fixed inability to clear shown annotations/metadata fields shown in the result tables (using custom js)
- Fixed dropdowns failing to close properly in IE11

# Miscellaneous improvements
- Added .article class to the main content container on the article page. This should help with article-specific styling
- Added the tab's name behind metadata fields in the summary at the bottom of the filters section
- Made document titles in the results table clickable across the entire width
- Added a search box to the format pickers shown when creating a new corpus and when downloading a preset
- Simple search field now has focus when the page is first opened
- In development mode, added a link to view a document's source xml at the bottom of the article page
- In development mode, also display annotation and metadata ids in addition to their name
- Various improvements to ease of use of the lexicon service 
- Improved layout in the tables showing available corpora on the home page
- Page will now display first content faster in IE11
- Fixed navbar logo wrapping on to new line when the window is small


# Removed features
- Removed the links next to hits in expanded hit rows. This feature did not work properly and will be revisited in the future.
