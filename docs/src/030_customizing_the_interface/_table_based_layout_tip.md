::: tip
Prefer the [table-based configuration](../search_form/show_hide_fields) for managing search form fields.  
It centralizes settings and uses the same underlying functions as manual methods.

:warning: The table-based method may not cover all cases. For advanced customizations, override with dedicated functions as needed.
