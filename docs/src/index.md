# BlackLab Frontend

The BlackLab Frontend is a webinterface for publishing and searching through text corpora, powered by [BlackLab](https://github.com/instituutnederlandsetaal/BlackLab/).
It is developed by the [Dutch Language Institute](https://ivdnt.org/) and is used to provide a user-friendly interface for searching through linguistic corpora.

At the [Dutch Language Institute](https://ivdnt.org/), we use it to publish our corpora such as [CHN](https://chn.ivdnt.org/) (CLARIN login required), [Letters as Loot](https://brievenalsbuit.ivdnt.org/). We also host an instance where you can try it out by uploading your own corpus data (privately), called [AutoSearch](https://portal.clarin.inl.nl/autocorp/) (CLARIN login required).

You can find links to specific documentation in the sidebar.

# Getting started

The simplest way to get started is to follow the basic [docker setup](/installation/install_using_docker).
